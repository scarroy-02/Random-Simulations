# Random-Simulations
An organized area to keep my simulations in place

0. Plotting program in Python
1. Dyck Path (starts with U and ends at (2n,0))
2. Directed animal simulation and counting
3. Simulation of directed animals in the triangular lattice uniformly
4. Simulation of Motzkin left factors uniformly
5. Counting of increasingly labelled directed animals in the square lattice
6. Counting of increasingly labelled directed animals in the triangular lattice
7. Tallying OEIS sequences to get Hook formula (Offline OEIS : https://oeis.org/wiki/Welcome#Compressed_Versions)
